    /// ### Description
    /// [**glCreateProgram**](crate::context::Context::oxidegl_create_program)
    /// creates an empty program object and returns a non-zero value by which it
    /// can be referenced. A program object is an object to which shader objects
    /// can be attached. This provides a mechanism to specify the shader objects
    /// that will be linked to create a program. It also provides a means for checking
    /// the compatibility of the shaders that will be used to create a program
    /// (for instance, checking the compatibility between a vertex shader and a
    /// fragment shader). When no longer needed as part of a program object, shader
    /// objects can be detached.
    ///
    /// One or more executables are created in a program object by successfully
    /// attaching shader objects to it with [**glAttachShader**](crate::context::Context::oxidegl_attach_shader),
    /// successfully compiling the shader objects with [**glCompileShader**](crate::context::Context::oxidegl_compile_shader),
    /// and successfully linking the program object with [**glLinkProgram**](crate::context::Context::oxidegl_link_program).
    /// These executables are made part of current state when [**glUseProgram**](crate::context::Context::oxidegl_use_program)
    /// is called. Program objects can be deleted by calling [**glDeleteProgram**](crate::context::Context::oxidegl_delete_program).
    /// The memory associated with the program object will be deleted when it
    /// is no longer part of current rendering state for any context.
    ///
    /// ### Notes
    /// Like buffer and texture objects, the name space for program objects may
    /// be shared across a set of contexts, as long as the server sides of the
    /// contexts share the same address space. If the name space is shared across
    /// contexts, any attached objects and the data associated with those attached
    /// objects are shared as well.

    /// calls when objects are accessed from different execution threads.

    /// ### Description
    /// [**glValidateProgram**](crate::context::Context::oxidegl_validate_program)
    /// checks to see whether the executables contained in `program` can execute
    /// given the current OpenGL state. The information generated by the validation
    /// process will be stored in `program` 's information log. The validation
    /// information may consist of an empty string, or it may be a string containing
    /// information about how the current program object interacts with the rest
    /// of current OpenGL state. This provides a way for OpenGL implementers to
    /// convey more information about why the current program is inefficient, suboptimal,
    /// failing to execute, and so on.
    ///
    /// The status of the validation operation will be stored as part of the program
    /// object's state. This value will be set to [`GL_TRUE`](crate::gl_enums::GL_TRUE)
    /// if the validation succeeded, and [`GL_FALSE`](crate::gl_enums::GL_FALSE) otherwise.

    /// If validation is successful, `program` is guaranteed to execute given
    /// the current state. Otherwise, `program` is guaranteed to not execute.
    ///
    /// This function is typically useful only during application development.
    /// The informational string stored in the information log is completely implementation
    /// dependent; therefore, an application should not expect different OpenGL
    /// implementations to produce identical information strings.
    ///
    /// ### Notes
    /// This function mimics the validation operation that OpenGL implementations
    /// must perform when rendering commands are issued while programmable shaders
    /// are part of current state. The error [`GL_INVALID_OPERATION`](crate::gl_enums::GL_INVALID_OPERATION)
    /// will be generated by any command that triggers the rendering of geometry
    /// if:
    ///
    /// > any two active samplers in the current program object are of different
    /// > types, but refer to the same texture image unit,
    ///
    /// > the number of active samplers in the program exceeds the maximum number
    /// > of texture image units allowed.
    ///
    /// It may be difficult or cause a performance degradation for applications
    /// to catch these errors when rendering commands are issued. Therefore, applications
    /// are advised to make calls to [**glValidateProgram**](crate::context::Context::oxidegl_validate_program)

    /// ### Parameters
    /// `program`
    ///
    /// > Specifies the handle of the program object whose executables are to be
    /// > used as part of current rendering state.
    ///
    /// ### Description
    /// [**glUseProgram**](crate::context::Context::oxidegl_use_program) installs
    /// the program object specified by `program` as part of current rendering
    /// state. One or more executables are created in a program object by successfully

    /// successfully compiling the shader objects with [**glCompileShader**](crate::context::Context::oxidegl_compile_shader),
    /// and successfully linking the program object with [**glLinkProgram**](crate::context::Context::oxidegl_link_program).
    ///
    /// A program object will contain an executable that will run on the vertex
    /// processor if it contains one or more shader objects of type [`GL_VERTEX_SHADER`](crate::gl_enums::GL_VERTEX_SHADER)
    /// that have been successfully compiled and linked. A program object will
    /// contain an executable that will run on the geometry processor if it contains
    /// one or more shader objects of type [`GL_GEOMETRY_SHADER`](crate::gl_enums::GL_GEOMETRY_SHADER)
    /// that have been successfully compiled and linked. Similarly, a program object
    /// will contain an executable that will run on the fragment processor if it
    /// contains one or more shader objects of type [`GL_FRAGMENT_SHADER`](crate::gl_enums::GL_FRAGMENT_SHADER)
    /// that have been successfully compiled and linked.
    ///
    /// While a program object is in use, applications are free to modify attached
    /// shader objects, compile attached shader objects, attach additional shader
    /// objects, and detach or delete shader objects. None of these operations
    /// will affect the executables that are part of the current state. However,
    /// relinking the program object that is currently in use will install the
    /// program object as part of the current rendering state if the link operation
    /// was successful (see [**glLinkProgram**](crate::context::Context::oxidegl_link_program)
    /// ). If the program object currently in use is relinked unsuccessfully, its
    /// link status will be set to [`GL_FALSE`](crate::gl_enums::GL_FALSE), but the
    /// executables and associated state will remain part of the current state
    /// until a subsequent call to [**glUseProgram**](crate::context::Context::oxidegl_use_program)
    /// removes it from use. After it is removed from use, it cannot be made part
    /// of current state until it has been successfully relinked.
    ///
    /// If `program` is zero, then the current rendering state refers to an *invalid*
    /// program object and the results of shader execution are undefined. However,
    /// this is not an error.
    ///
    /// If `program` does not contain shader objects of type [`GL_FRAGMENT_SHADER`](crate::gl_enums::GL_FRAGMENT_SHADER),
    /// an executable will be installed on the vertex, and possibly geometry processors,
    /// but the results of fragment shader execution will be undefined.
    ///
    /// ### Notes
    /// Like buffer and texture objects, the name space for program objects may
    /// be shared across a set of contexts, as long as the server sides of the
    /// contexts share the same address space. If the name space is shared across
    /// contexts, any attached objects and the data associated with those attached
    /// objects are shared as well.
    ///
    /// Applications are responsible for providing the synchronization across API
    /// calls when objects are accessed from different execution threads.
